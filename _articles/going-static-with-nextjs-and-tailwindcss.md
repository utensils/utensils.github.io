Before we broke ground on a new homepage we knew a migration to a different technology stack for exploratory and educational purposes was in order. With its rocket growth in popularity it was a no-brainer picking TailwindCSS, but even with the popularity I didn't set my hopes too high because admittedly: I don't enjoy CSS no matter what flavor, or so I thought.

The choices were made, code was written, and a site deployed. 

### TailwindCSS

> A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

There is no disputing TailwindCSS is long winded but it turns out to be a small price to pay when you'll need virtually no custom CSS.



### NextJS

> Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.
